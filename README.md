# `text-explorer`

In this assignment, we'll create a basic coordinate-based text game that allows the user to move on a 2D plane.

```
Your coordinates are (0, 0). Would you like to go "up", "right", "down", or "left"?
> left

Your coordinates are (-1, 0). Would you like to go "up", "right", "down", or "left"?
> up

Your coordinates are (-1, 1). Would you like to go "up", "right", "down", or "left"?
> right

Your coordinates are (0, 1). Would you like to go "up", "right", "down", or "left"?
> down

Your coordinates are (0, 0). Would you like to go "up", "right", "down", or "left"?
```

## Stretch goals

* In addition to showing the user's coordinates. Add a location to each coordinate. For example, (0, 0) could be the mountains. Check out https://www.asciiart.eu/ for text art inspiration.

```
Your coordinates are (0, 0).
You are in the mountains.

          /\
         /**\
        /****\   /\
       /      \ /**\
      /  /\    /    \        /\    /\  /\      /\            /\/\/\  /\
     /  /  \  /      \      /  \/\/  \/  \  /\/  \/\  /\  /\/ / /  \/  \
    /  /    \/ /\     \    /    \ \  /    \/ /   /  \/  \/  \  /    \   \
   /  /      \/  \/\   \  /      \    /   /    \

* Add some additional actions and interactivity to your game. Perhaps the goal of the game is to retrieve an item from one location and bring it to another!
